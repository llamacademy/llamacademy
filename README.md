### Mission
LlamAcademy is dedicated to helping you (YES YOU!) make your game development dream become a reality! üí£

Specifically by making Unity tutorials to show how to achieve different results or implement complex systems. The tutorials range from very basic introductary level programming to more advanced system implementations and optimization techniques.

I strive to show you a _scalable_ and _sustainable_ way to implement systems, behaviors, and effects. Not the quick and dirty way!

### Tutorials
You can find the tutorials on the [LlamAcademy YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LlamAcademy/). Each tutorial is accompanied by a full project repository here üéâ. The only things not included are the occasional Asset Store package that I cannot post publicly. Those dependencies are linked in the readme for each project.

So far I have:
 - Over 40 videos in the ‚öô [AI Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHFSDcEQuzQ&list=PLllNmP7eq6TSkwDN8OO0E8S6CWybSE_xC)
 - A more advanced tutorial series on creating a üí• [Scriptable Object Gun System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-vIMamyORg&list=PLllNmP7eq6TQJjgKJ6FKcNFfRREe_L6to)
 - Several Bullet and üöÄ [Bullet VFX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI3E7_f74MA&list=PLllNmP7eq6TRy4IPYo31iGF1a5plxMJ7u) tutorials
 - A few videos into the üë®‚Äçüíª [Introduction to Unity C#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXaa61JWLDw&list=PLllNmP7eq6TTjwoyfRYAAFOH1sMHVgI1r) series
