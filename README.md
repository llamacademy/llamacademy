### Mission
LlamAcademy is dedicated to helping you (YES YOU!) make your game development dream become a reality! 

Specifically by making Unity tutorials to show how to achieve different results or implement complex systems. The tutorials range from very basic introductary level programming to more advanced system implementations and optimization techniques.

### Tutorials
You can find the tutorials on the [LlamAcademy YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LlamAcademy/). Each tutorial is accompanied by a full project repository here ðŸŽ‰. The only things not included are the occasional Asset Store package that I cannot post publicly. Those dependencies are linked in the readme for each project.

So far I have:
 - Over 35 videos in the [AI Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHFSDcEQuzQ&list=PLllNmP7eq6TSkwDN8OO0E8S6CWybSE_xC)
 - Several Bullet and [Bullet VFX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI3E7_f74MA&list=PLllNmP7eq6TRy4IPYo31iGF1a5plxMJ7u) tutorials
 - A few videos into the [Introduction to Unity C#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXaa61JWLDw&list=PLllNmP7eq6TTjwoyfRYAAFOH1sMHVgI1r) series
 - Many other non-episodic content videos ðŸ˜‰

### Support
If you want to show your support for the cause, you can go to the [LlamAcademy Patreon](https://patreon.com/LlamAcademy) and make a monthly or one-time contribution. I also have some free and some paid assets on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/22409?_aid=1101l9QvC) <-- that's an affiliate link, you can also search "Llama Software" to find them all if you don't want to click that.

If _you_ need support or have questions, you can of course leave a comment on the video, or send an email to support@llama.software and I'll do my best to help you out.
